Events should now be sorted chronologically. Event dates and times aren't displayed in a way that's super 
readable. (Dates are "2024-02-16", etc and times are in 24-hour time). The routing and handlebars for event search and editing events are the main things not done yet. 

Student:
Sign up to the event planner, login, and then search for desired events.

Verified User:
Sign up, make your account field true on mongo, login, create an event with all necessary information.
