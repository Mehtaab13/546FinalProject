# 546FinalProject
Currently, the res.render the myCreatedEvents handlebars line is not working and I can't figure out why. 
It's line 310 in routes.js, in the viewcreatedevents route. Hopefully we can get it fixed Thursday or Friday. 
Everything else is working, except for the things that are still missing from this branch.
