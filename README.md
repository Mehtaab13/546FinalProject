1. Sign up with any email ending in @stevens.edu (it doesn’t have to be a real email address), and you will be redirected to a verification page. You can skip the verification step by simply going back and creating two more users. (Valid emails are not required if using MongoDB Compass. However, if you use a real email, a verification code will be sent to that address.) In MongoDB Compass, set the emailVerified field to true for all three users, and set the verified field to true for one of those users. That user will be allowed to create events. (We recommend not selecting the user associated with a real email address, because you will not receive registration emails.)

2. Sign in with the verified user. You will see a tab that allows you to create an event. Create an event following the specified constraints. Click the “Homepage” button, and you’ll see the event listed under “Upcoming Events,” as well as on the “Created Events” page (you can find a link to this page in the handlebars). On the “Created Events” page, you can view all created events and select a single event to see all its details and any feedback that users can submit once it begins. We recommend scheduling the event to start within the next 5–10 minutes so you can test the registration and feedback processes. (Note: You cannot register after the event has started, and you cannot register using the account that created the event.)

3. Click “Log Out” at the top of the page to return to the login screen. Now sign in with one of the unverified users (this type of user cannot create events). You will have fewer options, such as no ability to view or create events. However, you can still see upcoming events and search for events by entering a keyword and clicking “Search.” Click on the event created by the verified user and click “Register.” The attendee count for that event should now increase by one. Navigate to “My Registered Events” to confirm the event is listed there. If you used a real email address, you may receive a confirmation email (check your spam folder if you don’t see it). (We recommend completing this step quickly, so you can sign in with the second unverified user and register before the event starts.)

4. Log out again and sign in with the other unverified user. Register for the event in the same way. Now wait until the event’s start time. Once the event starts, return to the homepage, and you’ll notice that the event is no longer listed under “Upcoming Events.” Click on “Registered,” and the event will not appear there either. Navigate to the “Attended Events” tab and click on it. You will now see the event listed there. Select the event, and you will no longer see an “Unregister” button. Instead, you’ll see a feedback form allowing you to rate the event and leave a comment. (If the page is cut off, try zooming out.) After submitting your feedback, you will see it displayed, and the organizer’s rating will have updated based on your feedback.

5. Log out of that account and sign in with the other unverified account. Repeat the feedback submission process. You will see the rating update once again. The rating is the average of all user feedback ratings, rounded to the nearest decimal. This rating will appear on any new events created by the organizer, giving other users insight into the quality of the organizer’s events.

6. Log out once more and sign in with the verified user again. Click on “View All Created Events” and select the event you created. You will see all the event details as well as all the feedback that users have provided for that event.
